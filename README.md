# Los Angeles Crime Trends Interactive Dashboard

### 1. Project Overview
Created a visual intelligence tool to help users and law enforcement identify crime hotspots and temporal patterns in Los Angeles.

### 2. Dataset
Sourced from Los Angeles Open Data (Crime incidents from 2020 to present), including location, time of occurrence, and victim demographics.

### 3. Approach
* **Tools:** Tableau Public.
* **Techniques:** Geospatial mapping, time-series line graphs, and sideways bar charts.
* **Interactivity:** Implemented **Dashboard Actions** (filtering by Area) and synchronized tooltips.

### 4. Results
* **Insights:** Identified that crime is most concentrated around the **77th Street area** and most frequently occurs at **12:00 PM (noon)**.
* **Visuals:** A 3-tier dashboard layout that allows for drilling down from city-wide trends to specific crime types.

### 5. Key Learnings
I learned how to design for the "End User." Instead of just showing data, I built a hierarchy of information, starting with a high-level map and ending with granular victim demographics. I mastered Tableau's Dashboard Actions, which taught me how to manage state across multiple visualizations to provide a seamless user experience.
